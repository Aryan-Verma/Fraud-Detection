# Fraud-Detection
Model to detect fraud in credit card applications using Self-Organizing Maps and ANN

The model predicts the potential fraud in credit card applications. The dataset consists of information on customers applying for an advanced credit card. The dataset is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data.

The self-organizing map identifies the fraud and its result is used as input to the artificial neural network. The final output is the ranking of the predicted probabilities that each customer cheated.
